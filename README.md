# Harnessing the Power of Large Language Models for Automated Code Generation and Verification


## Description

This project aims to show how programming complex robot behavior can be simplified using the latest innovations from the Generative AI field, such as Large Language Models (LLMS).
The code here shows:
· Data comparing time required by human developers vs an (LLM based) automated system
· The sample code that was used in the paper "Harnessing the Power of Large Language Models for Automated Code Generation and Verification"
  

## Getting started

git clone (the repo) 

**To setup everything:**
First create (and activate) a Python3 virtual env:

    python3 -m -venv env
    source ./env/bin/activate
 Then install required libraries and set up your credentials:
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    copy _env.sample .env
  (then edit the .env file you created)

**To run the system:**

    asdas  

(this should copy the built files to the backend directory)
